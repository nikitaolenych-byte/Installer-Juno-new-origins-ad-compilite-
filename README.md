This repository contains a small demo web application: **SR2 Craft Generator** (located in `sr2-web-app/`). The demo helps generate SimpleRockets 2 `.craft` files from templates and optionally uses OpenAI to modify them from a natural-language description.

Demo (local): http://localhost:3000 — run the demo by following the instructions in `sr2-web-app/README.md`:

Temporary public demo (tunnel): https://salty-heads-shake.loca.lt — available while the local tunnel session is active.

Quick start:

1. cd sr2-web-app
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

See `sr2-web-app/README.md` for more details (OpenAI integration, preview, and usage notes).
